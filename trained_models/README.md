# Unveiling the potential of GNN for network modeling and optimization in SDN

RouteNet models already trained can be downloaded from these links:

* Delay model: http://knowledgedefinednetworking.org/data/trained_model_delay.zip
* Jitter model: http://knowledgedefinednetworking.org/data/trained_model_jitter.zip  
	(This last model was trained from a model of the delay in an early training stage. See further details in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08113))
